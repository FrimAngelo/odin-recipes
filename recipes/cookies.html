    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cookies are a timeless treat, beloved for their
         comforting sweetness and versatility. Whether you
          crave soft, chewy centers or crisp, golden edges, cookies are endlessly customizable to suit any preference.
           A classic recipe typically combines butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla for a rich and flavorful base, with flour, baking soda, and a pinch of salt providing structure. From there, the fun begins—add chocolate chips, nuts, 
           dried fruit, or spices like cinnamon to make the recipe your own. The dough is shaped into little rounds, baked to perfection,
         and cooled just enough to enjoy warm, melty goodness in every bite.</p>
     <p>The beauty of cookies lies in their simplicity and speed. In under an hour, you can go from craving to enjoying a fresh batch straight from the oven. Whether paired with a glass of milk, packed in a lunchbox, or served at a party, cookies have a universal appeal that brings smiles to every occasion. Their aroma wafting through the kitchen evokes nostalgia and warmth, making them 
        the perfect go-to recipe for any baking enthusiast.</p>

           <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
           <li>3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy (about 2–3 minutes).</li>
                <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined.</li>
                <li>Fold in the chocolate chips evenly.</li>
            </ul>
            <li> Shape the Cookies:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Scoop about 2 tablespoons of dough (or use a cookie scoop) and roll into balls.</li>
            <li>Place the dough balls on the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches of space between each.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bake the Cookies:</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Bake for 8-12 minutes, depending on your oven and preferred texture. The cookies should be golden brown around the edges but soft in the center.</li>
               <li>Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bake the Lasagna:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil (lightly greased on the underside to prevent sticking).</li>
                <li>Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes until bubbly and golden.</li>
                <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
